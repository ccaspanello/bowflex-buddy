Focus on practicing and learning your technique before increasing the resistance. Then move to a more challenging resistance that you can perform no less than 10 reps and no more than 15 reps without your form deteriorating. As you become stronger, you can advance to two sets for each exercise. Complete all sets of each exercise before moving on to the next one. Rest 30 to 45 seconds between sets. Move slowly on each rep. Use a pace that would allow you to stop the movement instantly at any point in the rep. Count three seconds up and three seconds down and work to fatigue during each set.",

    description: "Circuit training is a great way to achieve the benefits of strength training and cardiovascular training in one quick, challenging routine. The idea is to move quickly from exercise to exercise, taking only as much rest between sets as it takes to set up the next exercise (less than 20 seconds). One circuit equals one set of each exercise. Initially, start with completing one round of Circuit 1. Then add an additional round of the same circuit. Once you reach three rounds of Circuit 1, add one round of Circuit 2. Add additional rounds of Circuit 2 as your fitness level increases. Repeat process with Circuit 3. Do not let your heart rate exceed 220 minus your resting heart rate. Perform each rep of each exercise slowly and with perfect technique. Count three seconds up and three seconds down.",

    description: "This program is designed to emphasize overall strength development. This is an advanced routine to be used only after you have progressed from the advanced general conditioning routine and only after you have perfected your exercise techniques. Work each set to near exhaustion. If you can perform more than 5 to 8 reps, you should increase your resistance 5 pounds and decrease your reps to 5. Rest 60 – 120 seconds between each set and exercise. Focus on proper form. Tighten the muscle before you move, squeeze the muscle as you move, cramp the muscle at the point of full contraction, and resist the movement as you lower the weight. Move slowly on each rep. Use a pace that would allow you to stop the movement instantly at any point in the rep. Count two seconds up and four seconds down and work to fatigue during each set.",
